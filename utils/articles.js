          text: ["Babies thrive on predictability and routine. Their little worlds are full of action and stimulation, but providing a consistent routine offers safety and security. Did you know that by 8 weeks of age,your baby can recognize a bedtime routine? It’s true! He begins to learn that the series of events you do prior to bedtime means sleep is coming. Start tonight! Don't worry! Your bedtime routine does NOT have to be complicated. The most important thing about a bedtime routine is that you do the same things in the same order each night. That doesn't mean you have to read the exact SAME book, but you can! That doesn’t mean you have to give a bath EVERY night, but you can!"],

          text:['First, we want to make sure that your baby has good awake time before bed. An overtired baby at bedtime can cause huge bedtime battles. Likewise, not being tired enough can make falling asleep difficult. If you need help finding the right wake windows for your baby, this can help. You’ll also want to pay attention to the time on the clock. Most babies (older than 4 months) come to a natural lull between 7:00-8:00 pm. This time is typically when little ones fall asleep the easiest and stay asleep the longest. Now, some babies may need earlier, and some newborns may do better with later bedtimes, but 7:00-8:00 pm is often that sweet spot.'],

          title: 'What about bath time?',
          text: ["Science actually supports that a bath before bed can help promote sleep! Here’s why: During a warm bath, blood comes to the surface of the skin. This is called vasodilation. When we get out of the tub, blood vessels are still open, so our body temperature drops a bit. This slight drop in core body temp promotes sleep for us and our babies! A bath at the end of the day (followed by a bedtime routine) helps cue a baby's brain that bedtime is near. This can be an excellent way to prepare babies for night sleep. But does that mean I need to give a bath EVERY night? You can, but you don’t have to. Some families enjoy bath time every night, and for other families, this just doesn’t work best. It’s up to you! Taking the bath out of the sequence won’t ruin your bedtime routine. It’s the consistency after the bath that helps!"],

          text: ['Want an easy way to help your baby or toddler sleep? Pay attention to how long your baby or toddler is awake. Truly! Knowing your baby’s wake windows will help your baby fall asleep more easily and stay asleep longer! A wake window is the amount of time your baby or toddler is awake between one nap and the next. I like to count wake windows from the time you get your baby out of the crib or bassinet until you lay him down again. Wake windows include everything that happens while your baby or toddler is out of the bassinet or crib, including feeding, spending time outside, playing with toys, singing songs, reading books, and even the bedtime routine.'],

          text: ['Well, wake windows that are too long can result in an overtired baby or toddler who struggles to calm down enough to fall asleep or stay asleep. On the other hand, wake windows that are too short can result in a baby or toddler who simply isn’t ready to fall asleep or will only take a tiny catnap. If you get wake windows just right, you’re setting your baby or toddler up to be able to fall asleep more easily and stay asleep longer.'],

Watch the length and quality of your baby's naps and notice how she's acting! Remember, you know your baby best, so watch your baby - If she's cranky and struggling, shoot for the shorter end of the wake window range.⁣ If she's alert and active, aim for the longer end of the range. REMEMBER: Your baby is growing and developing rapidly. You’ll want to reevaluate baby’s wake windows each month!⁣ Combining what you know about your little one’s wake windows with their individual cues can help create a flexible routine for your day!"],

          text: ['Your baby or toddler’s wake window starts when she’s taken out of the crib and ends when placed back in the crib. I know you may see her moving around on the baby monitor for the next 10 minutes after putting her down for a nap – and that’s okay! Babies take anywhere from 5-20 minutes to fall asleep, while toddlers can take 20-30 minutes to fall asleep. And so as long as she’s laying in a good napping environment, this is considered rest time (and not active awake time). Here’s why: Think about the last time you laid in bed not really awake but not really asleep. This is your brain resting, and it’s the same for your baby or toddler. So those times your baby or toddler is awake just before falling asleep and at the end of the nap don’t really count as part of her wake window.'],

            "1. Practice during the day. Help your little one practice new skills on the floor. Did he learn to roll? Do lots of tummy time together. Is she a new crawler? Encourage that crawling by putting toys a bit out of reach. Newly sitting or standing? Practice going from standing to sitting and sitting to laying. All of this practice during the day will help make the new skill less exciting at night. It ALSO provides active and stimulating awake time that helps your baby's body prepare for sleep during naps and at night",
            "2. Consider a sleep sack. Sleep sacks are a great cue that it's time for sleep, reminding your little one that playtime is over. They can also limit mobility making that exciting new skill a little less enticing in the night or during nap time.",
            "3. Stay consistent AND give everyone grace. Don’t throw out all of your healthy sleep habits. There's no need to stop your normal routines and sleep strategies. At the same time, give yourself and your little one some grace. Learning a new skill is hard and exciting. This is temporary, and it will pass.    4. Create a strong sleep foundation BEFORE you hit these bumps.",
